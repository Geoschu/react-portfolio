          Hello! I'm a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and
          a strong interest in computer science. I have experience in front-end
          and back-end development, and I'm always eager to learn new
          technologies and improve my skills. In my free time, I enjoy building
          open-source projects and exploring the latest trends in the tech
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked on several projects, utilizing technologies such as
          React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am proficient in JavaScript, Python,
          and Java. I have a strong understanding of data structures and
          algorithms, and I am experienced in designing and implementing RESTful
          APIs. I am also familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I am a
          team player, and I believe in the power of collaboration to solve
          complex problems.
